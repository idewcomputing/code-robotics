how to create new app template in each code editor \(web editor & desktop editor\)

starter code for new app template \(web editor & desktop editor\)

## Create New Program

### Arduino Create Web Editor

To create a new sketch \(program\) in the Arduino Create Web Editor:

1. If necessary, click the "Sketchbook" menu in the left navigation panel to display the its menu options in the middle panel.
2. Click the "New Sketch" button at the top of the middle panel.

### Arduino IDE Desktop Editor

To create a new sketch \(program\) in the desktop version of the Arduino IDE code editor, do one of the following:

* Under the "File" menu, select "New"
* Alternatively, you can click the "New" icon \(looks like a document\) at the top of the code editor window.

### Both Editors

The editor will create a new sketch that **automatically** contains starter code similar to below:

```cpp
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

## Add Comment Block to Identify App

It is recommended to insert a comment block at the very top of your program to list a title for your app, your name, and any other information that might be helpful to you or to anyone else reviewing the program code.

A blank comment block is created with slashes and asterisks like this:

```cpp
/*

*/
```

In between the asterisks, you can list as many lines of comments as you want or need. This would be a good place to name your app and perhaps describe its purpose. You could also include other information, such as your team information, your teacher's name and class period, etc.

Find out if your teacher has specific information that should be listed in this block comment.

For example, your block comment might look like this:

```cpp
/*
Hello World App
Team 3 - Destiny, Katya, Lucas, Miguel
Ms. Hopper - Period 2
January 14, 2019
*/
```
