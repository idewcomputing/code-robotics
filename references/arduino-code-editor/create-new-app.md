how to create new app template in each code editor \(web editor & desktop editor\)

starter code for new app template \(web editor & desktop editor\)



## Create New Program

### Arduino Create Web Editor

To create a new sketch \(program\) in the Arduino Create Web Editor: 1. If necessary, click the "Sketchbook" menu in the left navigation panel to display your list of existing sketches. 2. Click the "New Sketch" button at the top of the middle panel.

### Arduino IDE Desktop Editor

To create a new sketch \(program\) in the desktop version of the Arduino IDE code editor, do one of the following:

* Under the "File" menu, select "New"
* Alternatively, you can click the "New" icon \(looks like a document\) at the top of the code editor window.

### Both Editors

The editor will create a new sketch that **automatically** contains starter code similar to below:

```cpp
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```
