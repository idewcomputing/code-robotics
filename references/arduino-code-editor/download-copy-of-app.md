# Download Copy of App

If necessary, you can obtain a copy of your app code \(as `.ino` file\).

You can view the file \(using a text editor\), copy the file, print it, upload it \(to submit to a teacher\), etc.

## Arduino Create \(Web Editor\)

All of your sketches \(apps/programs\) are saved in the cloud and can be easily downloaded.

1. If necessary, log in to the [Arduino Create](https://create.arduino.cc/editor/) web editor.
2. If necessary, click the **Sketchbook** menu link in the left navigation panel to display the Sketchbook menu options in the middle panel.
3. All of your saved sketches are listed in the middle panel. If you have lots of saved sketches, you can order the list by name or by last modified date. You can also search by name.
4. Once you find the sketch you want to download, you can click the drop-down arrow next to the sketch name, and in the pop-up menu, select "Download Sketch."
   * Alternatively, you can click on the sketch's name to load the sketch into the code editor panel. Then click the 3-dot button at the top of the code editor panel, and select "Download Sketch."
5. The sketch will be downloaded as a ZIP file \(compressed file\). After the download is complete, locate the ZIP file in the **Downloads** folder on your computer, and uncompress the ZIP file:
   * On a **Windows** computer, right-click the ZIP file, and select "Extract All." Browse to the destination  where you want to save the uncompressed file folder, and click "Extract."
   * On a **Mac** computer, just double-click the ZIP file. The uncompressed file folder will appear in your Downloads folder.
6. The uncompressed sketch will be contained inside a file folder with the same name as your sketch. Open the sketch's file folder. The sketch's filename will have an extension of `.ino` \(which identifies it as an Arduino program\). For example:  `hello_world.ino`
   * The folder will also contain a file named `ReadMe.adoc` and another file named `sketch.json`.  You don't need to submit those two files to your teacher.

## Arduino IDE \(Desktop Editor\)

All of your sketches \(apps/programs\) are saved on your computer and can be easily located.

1. Open the **Documents** folder on your computer, and locate the folder named **Arduino** \(which was automatically created when you first installed the Arduino IDE desktop editor\).
2. Inside the **Arduino** folder, there is a subfolder for each of your sketches. \(There will also be a folder named **libraries** that contains any libraries that you installed, such as the SparkFun RedBot Library.\)
3. Open the subfolder for the sketch that you need. The sketch's filename will have an extension of `.ino` \(which identifies it as an Arduino program\). For example: `hello_world.ino`
