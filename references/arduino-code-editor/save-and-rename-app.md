# Save and Rename App

## Save Your App Code

The Arduino code editor does **NOT** autosave as you type \(though you can turn this feature on in the web editor\), so be sure to periodically save your code as you work.

### Arduino Create \(Web Editor\)

At the top of the code editor panel, hover your mouse cursor over the button with 3 dots, and then select "Save" from the pop-up menu.

{% hint style="success" %}
**TURN ON AUTOSAVE:**  You can turn on autosave in the **Arduino Create** web editor \(but **not** the desktop editor\). Click the **Preferences** menu in the left navigation to display its menu options. Be sure "Enable Autosave" and "Save when verifying and uploading" are both checked.
{% endhint %}

### Arduino IDE \(Desktop Editor\)

Under the **File** menu, select "Save" â€“ alternatively, you can click the **Save** icon \(looks like a downward arrow\) at the top of the code editor window.

## Rename App

By default, a new sketch will be given a generic filename that starts with `sketch_` and includes the current date \(plus a letter, such as: `a`, `b`, `c`, etc.\).

You should rename your new sketch to give it a filename that will make it easy for you \(or anyone else\) to identify and find the program later.

### Arduino Create Web Editor

1. Hover over the 3-dot button at the top of the code editor panel, and then select "Rename Sketch..."
2. In the pop-up, replace the generic sketch name with a unique filename.
   * Use a name that will make it easy for anyone to identify this sketch later \(especially once you have multiple sketches saved in your Arduino account\).
   * The filename **cannot** contain spaces \(instead you can use an underscore as a "space"\).
   * Your teacher might have a specific filename format that you should use for certain programs.
3. Click the **OK** button to save the new name and close the pop-up.

### Arduino IDE Desktop Editor

**Rename New Program \(not yet saved\):** Under the **File** menu, select "Save". A pop-up dialog window will appear. Enter a new filename, and then click the **Save** button.

**Rename Existing Program \(previously saved\):** Click the down arrow icon in the top-right corner of the code editor window, and then select "Rename" in the drop-down list. A small dialog will appear at the bottom of the code editor window. Enter a new filename, and then click the **OK** button.

## Save Copy of App with New Name

You can use the "Save As" command to save a copy of an existing app as a new app with a different name. This is a useful way to copy an app and then modify its code.

### Arduino Create Web Editor

1. Hover over the 3-dot button at the top of the code editor panel, and then select "Save As."
2. In the pop-up, replace the existing sketch name with a new filename.
3. Click the **OK** button to save the new app and close the pop-up.

### Arduino IDE Desktop Editor

Under the **File** menu, select "Save As". A pop-up dialog window will appear. Enter a new filename, and then click the **Save** button.
