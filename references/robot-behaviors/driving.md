# Driving

These custom functions use the [wheel encoders](../physical-inputs/wheel-encoders.md):

* [`driveStraight()`](https://github.com/idewcomputing/code-robotics/tree/a64094b0d9c5c1da17c73efd3f8730c1ce974c2a/references/wheel-encoders.md#drive-straight-continuously) — drive straight continuously
* [`driveDistance()`](https://github.com/idewcomputing/code-robotics/tree/a64094b0d9c5c1da17c73efd3f8730c1ce974c2a/references/wheel-encoders.md#drive-straight-for-specific-distance) — drive straight for specific distance at specific motor power
