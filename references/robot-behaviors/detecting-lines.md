# Detecting Lines

These custom functions use the [IR line sensors](../physical-inputs/ir-line-sensors.md):

* [`followLine()`](https://github.com/idewcomputing/code-robotics/tree/a64094b0d9c5c1da17c73efd3f8730c1ce974c2a/references/ir-line-sensors.md#follow-line-automatically) — follow a line automatically
* [`avoidLine()`](https://github.com/idewcomputing/code-robotics/tree/a64094b0d9c5c1da17c73efd3f8730c1ce974c2a/references/ir-line-sensors.md#avoid-line-automatically) — avoid a line automatically \(acts like border to contain robot\)
* [`countLine()`](https://github.com/idewcomputing/code-robotics/tree/a64094b0d9c5c1da17c73efd3f8730c1ce974c2a/references/ir-line-sensors.md#count-lines-and-stop-at-target-number) — drive straight while counting lines crossed and stop at specific line number
* [`followCountLine()`](https://github.com/idewcomputing/code-robotics/tree/a64094b0d9c5c1da17c73efd3f8730c1ce974c2a/references/ir-line-sensors.md#follow-line-while-counting-lines-crossed) — follow a line while counting lines crossed and stop at specific line number
