# Detecting Other Conditions

These custom functions use the push button, IR line sensors, or accelerometer:

* `checkButton()` — check if button is being pressed
* `checkDropOff()` — check for surface drop-off
* `checkBump()` — check if robot has been bumped
* `measurePitch()` — measure pitch angle \(tilted up or down\)
* `measureRoll()` — measure roll angle \(tilted left or right\)
* `checkUpsideDown()` — check if robot is upside down
