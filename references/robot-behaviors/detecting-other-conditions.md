# Detecting Other Conditions

These custom functions use the push button, IR line sensors, or accelerometer:

* `checkButton()` — check if button is being pressed
* `checkDropOff()` — check for surface drop-off \(e.g., stair step, etc.\)
* `checkBump()` — check if robot has been bumped
* `measurePitch()` — measure pitch angle \(robot tilted up or down\)
* `measureRoll()` — measure roll angle \(robot tilted left or right\)
* `checkUpsideDown()` — check if robot is upside down \(pitch or roll greater than 90°\)
