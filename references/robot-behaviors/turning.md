# Turning

These custom functions also use the [wheel encoders](../physical-inputs/wheel-encoders.md):

* [`pivotAngle()`](https://github.com/idewcomputing/code-robotics/tree/a64094b0d9c5c1da17c73efd3f8730c1ce974c2a/references/wheel-encoders.md#pivot-both-wheels-by-specific-angle) — pivot on both wheels by specific angle
* [`turnAngle()`](https://github.com/idewcomputing/code-robotics/tree/a64094b0d9c5c1da17c73efd3f8730c1ce974c2a/references/wheel-encoders.md#turn-on-one-wheel-by-specific-angle) — turn on one wheel by specific angle
