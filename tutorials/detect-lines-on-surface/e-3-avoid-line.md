# E-3 Avoid Line

**STILL IN PROGRESS**

Next, you'll code an app that uses the IR line sensors to make your robot avoid a line. The line acts a border to keep the robot either inside \(or outside\) a certain area or path.

same line and surface conditions required as for following line

in this case, line as as border to keep robot either within an area \(if the robot is surrounded by a line\) or outside an area \(if the robot is outside an area surrounded by a line\) - show diagrams illustrating both

global variables for left and right motor powers

use avoidLine\(\) custom function - explain conceptually how it works

upload app to robot, place robot inside oval line border, and confirm it works - may need to adjust values in function \(such as: line threshold, etc.\) - test, adjust value, upload revised app, test again
