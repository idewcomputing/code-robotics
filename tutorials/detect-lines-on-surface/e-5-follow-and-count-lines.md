# E-5 Follow and Count Lines

**STILL IN PROGRESS**

Finally, you'll code an app that uses the IR line sensors to make your robot count line markers it crosses as it follows a line. The robot will stop driving when it reaches a specific line number. You can then make the robot turn and start following a new line.

get large sheet of paper \(such as: butcher paper, flip chart paper, etc.\), use black permanent marker \(not dry erase marker\) to draw 0.5 inch wide lines that form pattern shown in diagram \(main path with two side paths\)



use followCountLine\(\) custom function - explain conceptually how it works

also need followLine\(\) - used to make robot follow current line while it counts line markers crossed

also need driveDistance\(\) function - used to align center of robot with target line number
