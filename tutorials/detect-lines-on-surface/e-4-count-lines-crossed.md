# E-4 Count Lines Crossed

**STILL IN PROGRESS**

can either drive in straight line while counting line markers crossed

OR

can follow a line while counting line markers crossed \(lines can be straight or curved, as long as lines cross each other at 90Â° angle - furthermore, the lines do not necessarily have to form closed loops\)

in either case, robot will stop at desired line marker \(and then you can make robot turn and start driving in new direction or start following a new line\)

get large sheet of paper \(such as: butcher paper, flip chart paper, etc.\), use black permanent marker \(not dry erase marker\) to draw 0.5 inch wide lines that form pattern shown in diagram \(main path with two side paths\)

global variables for left and right motor powers

use followCountLine\(\) custom function - explain conceptually how it works

upload app to robot, and confirm it works - may need to adjust values in function \(such as: line threshold, etc.\) - test, adjust value, upload revised app, test again
