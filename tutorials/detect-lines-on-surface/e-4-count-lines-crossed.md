# E-4 Count Lines Crossed

**STILL IN PROGRESS**

Next, you'll code an app that uses the IR line sensors to make your robot count line markers it crosses as it drives straight. The robot will stop driving when it reaches a specific line number. You can then make the robot turn and start driving in a new direction.

get large sheet of paper \(such as: butcher paper, flip chart paper, etc.\), use black permanent marker \(not dry erase marker\) to draw 0.5 inch wide lines that form pattern shown in diagram \(main path with two side paths\)

use countLine\(\) custom function - explain conceptually how it works

also need driveStraight\(\) - plus global variables for left and right motor powers and previous left and right wheel encoder counts - used to make robot drive straight continuously while it counts lines crossed

also need driveDistance\(\) function - used to align center of robot with target line number

upload app to robot, and confirm it works - may need to adjust values in function \(such as: line threshold, etc.\) - test, adjust value, upload revised app, test again
