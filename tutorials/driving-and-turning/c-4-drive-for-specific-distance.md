# C-4 Drive for Specific Distance

**STILL IN PROGRESS**

use wheel encoders to drive in straight line for specific distance \(such as:  24 inches, 36 inches, etc.\)

use driveDistance\(\) custom function - explain conceptually how it works

upload app to robot, and confirm it works - may need to adjust correction value in function to get as close to intended distance as possible - test, adjust correction value, upload revised app, test again
