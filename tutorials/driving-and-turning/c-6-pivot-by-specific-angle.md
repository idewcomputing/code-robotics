# C-6 Pivot By Specific Angle

**STILL IN PROGRESS**

use wheel encoders to pivot by specific angle \(such as:  90째 right, 90째 left, 180째, 45째 right, etc.\)

use pivotAngle\(\) custom function - explain conceptually how it works

upload app to robot, and confirm it works - may need to adjust correction value in function to get as close to intended angle as possible - test, adjust correction value, upload revised app, test again
