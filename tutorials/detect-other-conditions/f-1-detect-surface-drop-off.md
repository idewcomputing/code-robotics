# F-1 Detect Surface Drop-Off

**STILL IN PROGRESS**

use IR line sensors to detect surface drop-off \(such as:  ledge or hole\)

use checkDropOff\(\) custom function - need to add code

upload app to robot, place robot on table pointing toward direction of table edge, and confirm it works - may need to adjust values in function \(such as: dropoff threshold, etc.\) - test, adjust value, upload revised app, test again
