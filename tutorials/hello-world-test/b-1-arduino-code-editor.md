# B-1 Arduino Code Editor

You will use an Arduino code editor \(also called an IDE â€“ Integrated Development Environment\) to create and save your Arduino apps for your robot. You'll also use the code editor to upload apps to your robot, in order to actually run them.

[Follow these instructions to set up an Arduino code editor on your computer](../../references/arduino-code-editor/).  There are two options:  you could use the **Arduino Create web editor** or the **Arduino IDE desktop editor**. Check with your teacher to see which editor you should set up.

Once your Arduino code editor is ready to use, go on to the next step in this tutorial.
