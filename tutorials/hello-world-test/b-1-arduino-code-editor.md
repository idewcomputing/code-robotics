# B-1 Arduino Code Editor

**STILL IN PROGRESS**

You will use an Arduino code editor \(also called an IDE – Integrated Development Environment\) to create and save your Arduino apps for your robot. You can either use an online code editor or a desktop code editor \(though your teacher might instruct you to use a particular editor\).

## Arduino Create Web Editor

If possible, it is highly recommended that you use the online Arduino Create web editor to create and save your Arduino programs in the cloud.

The Arduino Create web editor is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux and with most browsers \(Chrome, Firebox, Safari, and Edge\). You will need to create a free Arduino account and also install a browser plugin \(which requires **Administrator** access on your computer\).

Here are instructions for [Getting Started with Arduino Editor on Various Platforms](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Arduino_Genuino/getting-started-with-arduino-web-editor-on-various-platforms-4b3e4a).

The basic steps are:

1. [Create a new Arduino account](https://auth.arduino.cc/register). Sign up with an email account that you can access which can receive outside email \(some school email addresses cannot receive mail from outside the school district\). Be sure to create a secure password that you will remember.
2. After signing up, you will receive an email with a link to verify your new account. Click the link.
3. After verifying your new account, follow these steps to [install the browser plugin](https://create.arduino.cc/getting-started/plugin) on your computer \(which requires **Administrator** access\).
4. Once the browser plugin is installed, login to the [Arduino Create Web Editor](https://create.arduino.cc/editor).

## Arduino IDE Desktop Editor

Alternatively, you can download a desktop version of the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) code editor, which saves your Arduino programs locally on your computer.

Here is the page with links to [download the Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) for different computer platforms \(Windows, Mac, Linux\).

The basic steps are:

1. Click the appropriate download link for your computer platform \(Windows, Mac, Linux\). If you're using a Windows computer and do **not** have Administrator access, download the Windows ZIP file for non-admin install. \(The Mac download is a different ZIP file.\)
2. The download page asks for a donation – however, you can click the free link to "just download."
3. After the download is complete, locate the ZIP file in the Downloads folder on your computer, and uncompress the ZIP file:
4. On a **Windows** computer, right-click the ZIP file, and select "Extract All." Browse to the destination  where you want to save the Arduino application \(choose the Desktop if you don't have Administrator access to your Programs folder\), and click "Extract."
5. On a **Mac** computer, just double-click the ZIP file. Then drag-and-drop the Arduino application to your Desktop \(or to your Applications folder if you have Administrator access\).
6. Double-click the Arduino application icon to start the code editor.
