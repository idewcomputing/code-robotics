# B. Hello World Test

**STILL IN PROGRESS**

In this second tutorial, you'll program a "Hello World" app for your robot by using its LED light, speaker, and push button.

{% hint style="info" %}
**ALTERNATIVE TUTORIALS:** Instead of completing these tutorials, your teacher might instruct your team to complete the [SparkFun Experiment Guide for RedBot](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/experiment-guide-for-redbot-with-shadow-chassis). If so, you should complete all the experiments **except** Experiment 9 \(Remote Control\).

If your robot has an **ultrasonic sensor**, be sure to complete these tutorials for that sensor:  [D-3 Test Ultrasonic Sensor](../detect-objects-in-path/d-3-test-ultrasonic-sensor.md) and [D-4 Avoid Collisions](../detect-objects-in-path/d-4-avoid-collisions.md)

## Tutorial Goals  <a id="tutorial-goals"></a>

The goals of this tutorial are to help you:

* Understand how to use Arduino to program apps for your robot
* Create a Hello World app to learn how to control your robot's LED light, speaker, and push button
