# B. Hello World Test

**STILL IN PROGRESS**

In this second tutorial, you'll program a "Hello World" app for your robot by using its LED light, speaker, and push button.

{% hint style="info" %}
**ALTERNATIVE TUTORIALS:** Instead of completing these tutorials, your teacher might instruct your team to complete the [SparkFun Experiment Guide for RedBot](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/experiment-guide-for-redbot-with-shadow-chassis). If so, you should complete all the experiments except for Experiment 9 \(Remote Control\). However, if your robot has an ultrasonic sensor, be sure to complete the tutorial for that sensor.
