## Arduino Devices Store and Run One Program at a Time

Arduino devices, such as the RedBot, can only store and run **one** program at a time. If you want to change the program running on your robot, you have to upload a different program onto the robot.

However, you can create and save **multiple** programs in your Arduino account \(if using the online Arduino Create Web Editor\) or on your computer \(if using the desktop Arduino IDE\).

modify app \(change LED blink pattern\)
