# B-6 Upload App to Robot

**STILL IN PROGRESS**

Next, you'll upload your "Hello World" app to your robot to see if it works.

## Connect Robot to Computer

Your RedBot kit should have a USB to Mini-USB cable that allows you to connect the robot to a computer, in order to update the robot's app or to send serial data to the computer.

Plug the small end of this cable into the Mini-USB port on your RedBot circuit board. Plug the other end of the cable into a USB port on your computer.

## Turn On Robot Power

Your RedBot is powered by a 4-AA battery pack. Be sure the battery pack cable is plugged into the barrel jack on your RedBot circuit board.

Slide the RedBot's Power switch to ON.

If you were given an existing robot and its wheels start spinning when you turn the power on, you can temporarily slide the Motor switch to STOP.

## Arduino Devices Store and Run One Program at a Time

Arduino devices, such as the RedBot, can only store and run **one** program at a time. If you want to change the program running on your robot, you have to upload a different program onto the robot.

However, you can create and save **multiple** programs in your Arduino account \(if using the Arduino Create web editor\) or on your computer \(if using the Arduino IDE desktop editor\).

modify app \(change LED blink pattern\)
