## Speaker

The RedBot has a small speaker \(labeled as a "buzzer"\) attached to I/O pin 9 on the circuit board.

This speaker can produce simple sounds. The speaker can only play one tone \(sound\) at a time, but you can create different sounds or sound patterns. You could even program it to play simple music by playing one note at a time.

Sounds could be useful as audio alerts or feedback to people interacting with your robot.
