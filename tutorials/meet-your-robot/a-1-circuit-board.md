# A-1 Circuit Board

## Circuit Board

The SparkFun RedBot kit contains a printed circuit board \(PCB\) that incorporates an ATmega328P microcontroller, which will act like the “brain” of your robot. SparkFun refers to this circuit board as the RedBot mainboard.

A microcontroller is a small computer on a single integrated circuit that contains a processor \(CPU\), memory, storage, and programmable input/output pins.

Compared to the tech specs of a "regular" computer, a microcontroller is much less powerful – it has a slower processor, less memory, and less storage. This is because microcontrollers are used in devices that have dedicated functions \(such as: automobile engine control systems, medical devices, office machines, appliances, etc.\). These dedicated devices typically don’t require as much computing power to perform their specialized tasks.

The RedBot circuit board also has various pins, ports, buttons, switches, and LED lights. Different inputs \(such as: sensors, etc.\) and outputs \(such as: motors, etc.\) are connected to the pins on the circuit board, in order to create a functioning robot. You can control the robot by programming an app that will run on the microcontroller.
