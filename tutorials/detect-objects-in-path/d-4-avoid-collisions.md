# D-4 Avoid Collisions

**STILL IN PROGRESS**

use ultrasonic sensor to avoid collisions with objects, and change robot's path

use avoidCollisions\(\) custom function - need to add code

can modify code to perform other actions, such as trying to navigate around the object \(include diagram showing possible path\) - or checking both left and right for possible open path
