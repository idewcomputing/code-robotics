# D-3 Test Ultrasonic Sensor

**STILL IN PROGRESS**

if necessary:  connect sensor wires to circuit board, and mount sensor at front of robot

global variables for sensor pins \(TRIG, ECHO\)

set pin modes for sensor

use measureDistance\(\) custom function - explain conceptually how it works

use testUltrasonic\(\) custom function to use serial monitor to view distance measurements
