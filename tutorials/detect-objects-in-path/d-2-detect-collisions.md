# D-2 Detect Collisions

**STILL IN PROGRESS**

use mechanical bumpers to detect collisions with objects, and change robot's path

use checkBumpers\(\) custom function - need to add code

for left bumper collision:  brake, drive backwards, turn right, drive forward

for right bumper collision:  brake, drive backwards, turn left, drive forward

for both bumper collision:  brake, drive backwards, turn around, drive forward

can modify code to perform other actions, such as trying to navigate around the object \(include diagram showing possible path\)
