# F. Detect Other Conditions

In this sixth tutorial, you'll learn how to make your robot detect other environmental conditions \(e.g., drop-offs, bumps, etc.\) using its IR line sensors and accelerometer.

## Tutorial Goals <a id="tutorial-goals"></a>

The goals of this tutorial are to help you:

* Program a robot app that uses the IR line sensors to detect a surface drop-off
* Program a robot app that uses the accelerometer to detect if the robot has been bumped
* Program a robot app that uses the accelerometer to detect if the robot is upside down
